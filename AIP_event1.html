                    A Connection Through Food: Luna’s LUNpias Ribbon Cutting Ceremony in Poway California

                <p>
                    On Saturday, October 28, 2023, 
                    <a href="https://lunaslunpias.com/">Luna’s LUNpias</a>
                    , a Filipino style restaurant with a twist, 
                    held their ribbon cutting ceremony to celebrate their official opening in Poway, 
                    California.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This family owned kitchen and dining was created by Luna, a mother of five, 
                    who grew up in the heart of a bustling Filipino kitchen, learning the secrets 
                    behind her parent’s baking. In 2020, Luna’s family faced uncertainty and 
                    unemployment, and she and her husband ended up returning to the kitchen to 
                    do what they loved. 

                </p>
                <p>
                    As the Pandemic progressed, Luna began offering her baked goods to friends 
                    and family, which became the start of her incredible business. In less than 
                    three years, Luna’s LUNpias has grown in popularity throughout Southern 
                    California and neighboring states.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Luna has expressed her sincere gratitude for the support of her family 
                    and community, and stated, “Food, as a universal language, has allowed 
                    me to connect with diverse individuals, near and far, while doing what I 
                    cherish the most.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a representative of Supervisor Joel Anderson, the Supervisor of the 
                    County of San Diego, I drove to Poway to congratulate 
                    Luna and her family on their incredible work, and present her and her family 
                    with certificates of recognition at their ribbon cutting ceremony.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “It is my personal honor to present these certificates to Luna’s LUNpias 
                    to be commended on this day, October 28th, 2023. Congratulations, and 
                    on behalf of Supervisor Anderson, thank you,” I had said into the microphone, 
                    to the small crowd gathered outside their new Poway restaurant location.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Proud tears were shed by Luna, and the audience passionately cheered 
                    and applauded her. The restaurant itself had been packed with eager 
                    customers and filled with excited chattering, complete with a DJ playing 
                    music outside. Friends, families, and newcomers connected over Luna’s 
                    unique and innovative Filipino food.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Luna and her family business, born from the kindness of offering food 
                    to others during difficult times, has created a community of enthusiastic 
                    individuals with their incredible recipes and exceedingly warm-hearted 
                    and welcoming environment.
